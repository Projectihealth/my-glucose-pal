# Frontend workspace

React + Vite application for My Glucose Pal. Common commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # starts Vite on http://localhost:8080
npm run build    # outputs to dist/
```

Static CGM pattern CSVs live in `public/patternshapes`, so they are copied to the
final build without extra configuration.
