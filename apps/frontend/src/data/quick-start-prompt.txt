I need you to generate a monthly CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitor) report. I'll provide you with:
1. A JSON template structure you must follow exactly
2. Sample CGM data
3. Activity logs

Please analyze the data and return a complete JSON report following the template structure.

04:00 - 85 mg/dL
05:00 - 95 mg/dL
06:00 - 115 mg/dL (waking up)
07:00 - 130 mg/dL
08:00 - 165 mg/dL (post-breakfast spike)
09:00 - 155 mg/dL
10:00 - 135 mg/dL
11:00 - 120 mg/dL
12:00 - 135 mg/dL
13:00 - 180 mg/dL (post-lunch spike)
14:00 - 160 mg/dL
15:00 - 135 mg/dL
16:00 - 110 mg/dL (afternoon dip)
17:00 - 120 mg/dL
18:00 - 145 mg/dL
19:00 - 195 mg/dL (post-dinner spike)

23:00 - 105 mg/dL

Nov 2-30: Similar patterns with variations
- Morning spikes (6-8 AM): Present 18/30 days, avg +35 mg/dL
- Post-meal spikes: Breakfast +48, Lunch +52, Dinner +65 mg/dL
- Overnight stability: Good, ±12 mg/dL variation
- Afternoon dips (3-4 PM): Present 12/30 days, avg -28 mg/dL
- Low glucose events: 8 events total (2 very low <54, 6 low 54-69)
- High glucose events: 63 events (45 high 181-250, 18 very high >250)

PART 4: ACTIVITY LOGS

Sleep Logs:
Nov 1: 6.5h (poor quality)
Nov 2: 7.8h (good quality)
Nov 3: 8.2h (excellent - next day TIR: 82%)
Nov 4: 7.0h (good)
Nov 5: 5.8h (poor - next day TIR: 65%, morning glucose 145)
...
Average: 7.2 hours/night
Pattern: Good sleep (>7h) → 15% better TIR next day

Meal Logs:
Nov 1:
  07:30 - Breakfast: Oatmeal with berries (45g carbs) → spike to 165
  12:45 - Lunch: Grilled chicken salad (20g carbs) → spike to 180
  19:30 - Dinner: Pasta with vegetables (60g carbs) → spike to 195

Nov 2:
  08:15 - Breakfast: Eggs and toast (30g carbs) → spike to 148
  13:00 - Lunch: Turkey sandwich (35g carbs) → spike to 170
  20:00 - Dinner: Stir-fry with rice (55g carbs) → spike to 200

...
Patterns detected:
- Early breakfast (<8 AM): 18% lower post-meal spikes
- Late dinner (>8 PM): Worse overnight control
- Meal spacing >4h: More stable glucose

Exercise Logs:
Nov 1: 30 min yoga at 8:15 AM → improved glucose all day
Nov 2: None
Nov 3: 45 min walk at 7:30 AM → excellent glucose control (TIR 82%)
Nov 4: 20 min strength training at 6 PM
...
Frequency: 4.2 days/week (up from 2.8 last month)
Average duration: 35 minutes
Pattern: Morning exercise (7-9 AM) shows strongest effect → 12% higher TIR
Exercise days had 4-6 hours of improved glucose control after

Stress Logs:
Nov 5: High stress (work deadline) → glucose spike to 185 at 3 PM
Nov 12: High stress (poor sleep + meeting) → elevated all day
Nov 19: High stress → afternoon spike
...
High stress days: 8 total (27% of month)
Pattern: Stress → +18 mg/dL average, typically 2-5 PM spikes

PART 5: INSTRUCTIONS

Based on this data, generate a complete monthly CGM report by:

1. Calculating accurate metrics:
   - Time in Range (70-180): Estimate ~78%
   - Average glucose: ~112 mg/dL
   - Coefficient of Variation: ~28%
   - Weekly progression: Week 1: 72%, Week 2: 76%, Week 3: 81%, Week 4: 83%

2. Identifying patterns:
   - Morning spikes (dawn phenomenon)
   - Post-meal glucose responses
   - Overnight stability
   - Afternoon dips
   - Behavior correlations

3. Generating 6 prioritized recommendations:
   - 2 HIGH priority (biggest impact opportunities)
   - 3 MEDIUM priority (good improvements)
   - 1 LOW priority (fine-tuning)

4. Highlighting wins:
   - TIR improved 72% → 83% (+11%)
   - Exercise consistency improved
   - Overnight control excellent
   - Reduced hypoglycemia by 40% vs last month

5. Areas for improvement:
   - Morning spikes (biggest opportunity)
   - Dinner timing and composition
   - Weekend meal consistency

Return ONLY the JSON object following the template structure exactly.
Be specific, quantitative, and actionable in recommendations.
